# Hotel_id-recognition
It is a hotel recognition solution for human trafficking investigations since victims are often photographed in hotel rooms. Identifying these hotels is vital to trafficking investigations as they can help track down current and future victims who might be taken to the same places. We are required to identify the hotel seen in test images from the TraffickCam dataset, which are based on a large gallery of training images with known hotel IDs. For any test image, we should predict the most similar hotel id's sorted in the most relevant to least relevant order.
